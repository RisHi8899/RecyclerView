1) Create Activity_main.xml and set the recyclerView with a width of match parent and height of wrap content
2) Find ID of recycler view in MainActivity.kt
3) Set the layout manager in recyclerView

 Here's a practice question related to RecyclerView in Android development:

Question:
Create an Android application that displays a list of items using a RecyclerView. Each item in the list should display an image and some text. The image should be displayed on the left side of the item, and the text should be displayed on the right side. When the user clicks on an item, display a toast message showing the text associated with that item.

You can assume that the images and text are provided in arrays or lists within the application. Focus on implementing the RecyclerView, creating the item layout, and handling item clicks.

Feel free to ask for clarification or assistance if needed!
